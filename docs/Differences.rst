Differences
===========

The difference of one gemetric object with another geometric object is the part of the original gemetric object which does not intersect with the second geometric object.

General rules:

	- if object #1 and object #2 do not intersect, then the difference of object #1 to object #2 is itself, i.e. object #1.
	- if object #2 contains object #1, then the difference of object #1 to object #2 is None or an Empty Sequence.

The following difference methods are available:
